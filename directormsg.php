<div class="dm5">Sports unify people together irrespective of there age, gender and religion. They also bring out the best among individual and give us human being of extra capabilities,  ones that leaves their marking the history book for ever. While lot of Countries have had a successful Sporting Culture, India has always being a Sports Loving Country but not a Sports Playing Country.

	Over the last few years India has seen Sports boom like never before. Young achievers in a variety of Sports has grown with an increasing number of Medals being won at Olympics, Asian Games, Common Wealth Games and other International events. 

	At Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya We offers a variety of Games and Sports for Students. Our ultimate goal is to increase the participation in Sports. I believe Sports provide the required exposure for the students to grow and mature to adulthood. Sports helps to inculcate Team Work, Commitment, Discipline Leadership, Hard Work, Tufness, Sportsmanship, Sacrifice and above  all Character building. Sports prepare individuals for the Journey of Life that lies ahead of them. 

	I request every one our Students, Staff, Parents and Faculties to dedicate at least 40 minutes per day for your self and utilized this time on the Playfield, Gymnasium or in Park for their healthy and fit life.
